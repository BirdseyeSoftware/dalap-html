# dalap-html

dalap-html provides an easy yet powerful library to render your
templates using either Clojure (for server side rendering) or
Clojurescript (for client side rendering).

If you are familiar with hiccup/crate, then getting started with this
library should be really straightforward.

## Project Goals

_Another rendering library... really?_. Yep, although libraries out
there do a pretty good job, we were looking for more flexibility at
the time of managing our views. dalap-html provides:

* Different protocols that you can extend with your own types for
  maximum customization.

* Allows to transform/decorate your templates after definition by
  using something similar to CSS selectors (a la enlive).

* Provides automatic HTML escaping, if you want something to not be
  escaped, you have to be explicit about it.

## Project Maturity

dalap-html is a very young library; started in December 2011, used to
manage HTML templates and rendering for projects Birdseye Software
develops.
